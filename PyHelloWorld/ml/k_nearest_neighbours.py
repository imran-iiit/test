"""
    Which group is the given point closest to i.e. if k=3, what are the 3 nearest points to the given point,Ãè so that the new point is in that group.
 
    This is a simple algo, which runs really fast and scales well as we are just calculating the Euclidian 
    distances between two points at a given time.
